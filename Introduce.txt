The Social Media Platform System I developed includes key features such as user registration, login authentication, posting, and commenting. Users can register and log in with their mobile numbers, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience. Authentication mechanisms ensure only authorized users can post or comment. The system allows users to create, view, edit, or delete posts, and interact with posts by adding comments.

The frontend is built with Vue.js, and the backend uses Spring Boot with RESTful API standards. Maven is the chosen build tool, and database interactions are handled through Stored Procedures. Transactions are implemented to maintain data consistency during multi-table operations. The system also includes security measures against SQL Injection and XSS attacks, with database scripts organized in a \DB directory for easy management.
